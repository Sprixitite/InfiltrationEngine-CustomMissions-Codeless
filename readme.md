# InfiltrationEngine Codeless
Command line application which automatically manages gist repos for InfiltrationEngine custom mission codes

Documentation is currently lacking as this program is in an early state and is only suitable for use by those proficient enough in git to have a correctly configured local git environment, although this may at some point change if I ever get bored and decide to make the program function as a GUI app

Currently, supported codes are only generated by [the codeless branch of my exporter fork](https://github.com/Sprixitite/InfiltrationEngine-ToolingForTinkerers/tree/codeless) - however should other forks wish to implement support they are free to do so

## CLI Options
Currently the only CLI option intended for use by the end user is the `--standby` flag which - if set - will poll the clipboard every 0.5s to check if its contents are a supported InfiltrationEngine custom mission code. If the contents are a supported code then the program will automatically commit the contents of the clipboard to the local repository, and subsequently push the changes to the repository's remote origin.
