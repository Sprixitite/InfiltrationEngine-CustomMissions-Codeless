# InfiltrationEngine Codeless
Command line application which automatically manages gist repos for InfiltrationEngine custom mission codes

Documentation is currently lacking as this program is in an early state and is only suitable for use by those proficient enough in git to have a correctly configured local git environment, although this may at some point change

Currently, supported codes are only generated by [the codeless branch of my exporter fork](https://github.com/Sprixitite/InfiltrationEngine-ToolingForTinkerers/tree/codeless) - however should other forks wish to implement support they are free to do so

As of `v0.2.0` this program offers an interactive terminal user interface (TUI) which has been tested and found to function correctly on Linux (Pop!_os 22.04) and Windows 10 (CMD+Powershell, OS version unknown)

## Building
Assuming you have caro installed, building + installing the program should be as simple as running
```bash
cargo install --path .
```
Followed by either manually deleting the folder containing this README file, or running
```bash
cargo clean
```
Once installed, check the program is installed correctly by running
```bash
infilengine_codeless --help
```

## Usage
General usage is as follows:
1) Create a `ToolingIsCodeless` attribute on `workspace` and set it to `true`
2) Create a `Codeless_Remote` attribute on `workspace` and set it to the remote name you wish the program to use for exporting - usually this should be "`origin`"
3) Create a `Codeless_RepoFile` attribute on `workspace` and set it to the name of the file you wish for your mission to use in your repository - this can be anything
4) Start this program
5) Direct the program to the git repo your custom mission resides in
6) Return to studio and open the exporter
7) Press "Codeless Export"
8) Proceed with any authentication the program prompts

If any step fails, please troubleshoot before filing a bug report

## CLI Options
The program has support for numerous command line arguments, these currently consist of the following:

`(-h/--help)` - Print help

`(-V/--version)` - Print version

`(-r/--repo-path) <PATH>` - The path to the custom mission gist repo on disk, defaults to current working directory in non-interactive mode

`(-p/--port) <PORT>` - The local port on which to start the internal http server [default: 47362]

`(-e/--no-interact)` - Disables interactive terminal interface

`(-c/--hide-url)` - If enabled, censors the gist URL in the server log - I added this so I can stop editing my screenshots

`(-d/--download-repo)` - [Experimental] Use the program to clone a gist repo without the need of interfacing with a git client

`(--redraw-delay) <MILLISECONDS>` - The delay between passive terminal redraws in milliseconds Does not affect redraws which occur when requesting/receiving user input in interactive mode [default: 250]
